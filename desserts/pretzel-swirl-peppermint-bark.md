Pretzel Swirl Peppermint Bark
==========

Ingredients
---------
+ 6oz chocolate candy melts, chopped
+ 3oz milk chocolate, chopped
+ 6oz vanilla/white candy melts
+ 3oz white chocolate baking squares, chopped
+ 1/3c candy canes, crushed
+ 1/3c pretzels, crushed
+ red holiday sugar sprinkles (optional)

Directions
---------
1. Line a baking sheet with foil.
2. In a dry* saucepan over very low heat (you can also use a double-boiler or your microwave in 30 second increments, stirring in between), melt the chocolate candy melts and the milk chocolate, stirring frequently until smooth. Pour the chocolate onto the foil and spread out into a large rectangle using an offset spatula.
3. In another dry saucepan over very low heat, melt together the white candy melts and the white chocolate, stirring often, until smooth. Pour the white chocolate over the chocolate and spread carefully with an offset spatula to cover the chocolate layer. Then, using the tip of the spatula, swirl the white chocolate and the chocolate together, making a pretty design in the chocolates.
4. Sprinkle the swirled chocolate with peppermints and pretzels, followed by sugar sprinkles. Place the pan into the refrigerator for 30 minutes until firm. Break the bark into pieces and store in an airtight container. This makes a lovely holiday food gift.

Tips
----------
1. The little candy canes are much, much easier to unwrap than the tightly wrapped larger versions.
2. Make sure that your pans, stirring implements, and spatulas are all completely dry (free of water drops). If water gets into your chocolate, the chocolate will seize. The chocolate will also seize up if you burn it, so be careful to stir frequently and take it off the heat as soon as it is melted and smooth.
